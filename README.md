# 🎣 Hook n' Cook - Seafood Restaurant Website

A modern React JS website for Hook n' Cook, a seafood restaurant chain founded by student entrepreneurs. Built with Vite for fast development and hot reloading.

## 🌊 About Hook n' Cook

Hook n' Cook was born when a group of ambitious college students noticed something missing in the casual dining world – affordable, quality seafood for everyday people. Inspired by chains like Chili's and Applebee's, we set out to make fresh seafood accessible to everyone.
